# Exoticca Test Xavi Rincon

This is a project created for the Exoticca test by Xavi Rincon.

## Improvements that could have been done but I didn't have the time

- Add i18n for internationalization
- Do a prettier searchbar (Didn't have any design)
- Do a better search solution for more optimal results.
- I only added testing for the functional part of the app, the Searchbar. I don't see the point of testing a component without logic like the button, the tag or the text :)
